number_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] # from this list we need to make a list with only even numbers

# 1st method is with our normal for loop

# new_list = []

# for number in number_list:
#     if number%2 == 0:
#         new_list.append(number)

# print(f'new list with even entries {new_list}')

# 2nd method--> whenever we require a new list as an output we can list comprehension method

## syntax of list comprehension when there is only if condition in solving problem

### general syntax--> new_lsit_variable_name + [output for loop if condition], output at the front is output of if condition

# new_list = [number for number in number_list if number%2==0]

# print(new_list)


# new_list = []

# for number in number_list:
#     if number%2 == 0:
#         new_list.append("even")
#     else:
#         new_list.append("odd")

# print(new_list)

# or

new_list = ["even" if i%2==0 else "odd" for i in range(1,11)] # if we have if else condition this how we write list comprehension. The output is typed before the respective condition

print(new_list)
